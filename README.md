# GreenCab *Your new green way of travel!*

>Hi, my name is Viktor Hultman and this is my green taxi mock-up app for one of my school projects!

### What is this project?

This project was the seccond part of our UX course where we were to implement the design and functionallity
of our [clickable prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/zoafAjyjN8TGlHJ7hPRVMB/H%C3%A5llbart-Resande-Grupp-4-team-library?node-id=0%3A1) to a coding project.

The biggest challange was to use mapbox to create the map, pins, search functionality and rough direction lines.

My project focused on "creating" a fully green taxi app, by taking inspiration from other existing apps (Good and bad).

Here is [the app (GreenCab)](https://viktor-hultman.github.io/GreenCab/) that is currently deployed on github pages.

To run/edit the project on your computer:
> - Fork or clone the repo.
> - Open the index.html file in your browser.
> - And you are good to go!

Feel free to take inspiration from my solutions to improve your projects
